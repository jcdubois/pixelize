TODO list from Pixelize 2.0.0

- Option to tag good images and scroll between them

- Make all of the error and warning messages that Pixelize
  currently prints to the console, come up in a popup
  window.

- Make Pixelize deal with aspect ratios correctly.  I think
  this will be really hard, since the current way of storing
  the info in pic_db.dat knows nothing about aspect ratio.

- Add a percent done thingy to Pixelizwhen reading pic_db.dat.

- Add a Zoom-in/Zoom-out slider

- Hourglass
   - Done v0.9.0

- make_db meeds to know about your X display.  This is
  stupid since make_db never opens any windows.  This is
  an issue with imlib.
   - imlib dependency removed in v1.0.0

- Option to toggle between the origional and rendered image.
   - Done v1.0.0

- Write man pages.
   - Done v2.0.0

- Add an option to make_db to update the pic_db.dat file by
  somehow checking if files have been added, removed
  or changed, and then changing pic_db.dat as required.
    -Done v2.0.0
