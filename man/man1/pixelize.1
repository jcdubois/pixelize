pixelize - Create an image consisting of many small images

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBpixelize \fR[OPTIONS] [image_file]
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBpixelize\fR is a program that will use many scaled down images to try to duplicate, as closely as possible, another image.
.br

\fBpixelize\fR  works by splitting up the image you want rendered (or duplicated) into a grid of small rectangular areas. Each area is  analyzed, and  replaced  with  an  image chosen from a large database of images. \fBpixelize\fR tries to pick images that best matches each area.
.br

Note: Before running \fBpixelize\fR you have to create an image database  (a file called \fBpic_db.dat\fR) using the \fBmake_db\fR(1) utility.
